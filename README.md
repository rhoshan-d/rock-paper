## Testing 

The goal of this project was to be a simple enough but still engaging rock paper scissors game. You play against bob the computer and if you can win 5 rounds in a row you will receieve a random prize from the prize pool. I had the plan of adding a currency system but due to the lack of time and things going on that was not fully complete.
