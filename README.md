## Testing 

<!-- I began by using Love Maths as a reference since I lack expertise in design and lean more towards backend development, where my interests lie. I ensured responsiveness across all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, was a priority achieved through media queries and flexible styling. The cover text banner smoothly adjusts with tab resizing. Initially, the "Buy now" button appeared satisfactory, but a last-minute fix was necessary due to an error uncovered during code validation (I nested a button element within an <a> element oops!). While aiming to minimize the use of images for performance reasons, I incorporated hover effects for visual appeal, maintaining a consistent blue theme throughout. -->
